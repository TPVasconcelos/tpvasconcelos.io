- _“The second virial coefficient of bounded Mie potentials”_ -
    The Journal of Chemical Physics 147, 214504 (2017)

    This work is concerned with, for the first time, the derivation of
    analytic expressions in the form of series expansions for the second
    virial coefficient of bounded Mie potentials. This generalisation of
    the Mie potential allows for potential functions which are finite
    at the origin. The convergence properties and considerations of
    those parameter which give thermodynamic stability are investigated.

My research efforts were focused on a "bounded potential model" commonly
used to describe the interaction between particles in colloid and
polymer systems. I started by deriving several properties that this
potential should satisfy. However, the primary goal of the project was
to derive a series expansion solution to the _second virial coefficient_
of this bounded potential. Although I successfully derived a series
expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials, the convergence of this
series was too slow for practical applications.

I have received
excellent feedback from my supervisor and the project markers regarding
my performance, enthusiasm and initiative. Additionally, and maybe more
importantly, this project has allowed me to make my first original
contribution to science and reinforced my interest and commitment to
pursue a career in scientific research. The work done on this thesis
was expanded on a collaboration with Professor David M Heyes (my BSc
thesis supervisor), and
[published in The Journal of Chemical Physics](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5006035).


**Official written-comments from the thesis supervisor and markers:**

> “Tomas observed and brought out […] a number of very interesting results, of a calibre which would reflect well on a researcher of many more years experience.”

> “The series expansion and MD modelling aspects of the project were definite steps forward in our understanding of the behaviour of this system."

> “[Tomas] derived single-handedly a series expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials, which is a new approach as far as I am aware.”

> “His overall performance was in the excellent category.”
