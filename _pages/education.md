## Mathematics GradDip

- **Institution:** King’s College London - University of London, UK
- **Period:** Sep 2017 - Ongoing

During this 1 year mathematics graduate programme at KCL, I developed a
strong and robust mathematical foundation for further studies and
research in theoretical physics. Many of the technical skills I acquired
here are highly transferable to other fields of applied mathematics and
statistics. My mathematical intuition to interpret and build
mathematical models for simple and complex systems was refined.




## Physics BSc

- **Institution:** Royal Holloway, University of London, UK
- **Classification:** First Class Honours
- **Period:** Sep 2013 - Jun 2017

As one of the main goals of any Physics Undergraduate degree, I
developed the intuition to identify relevant laws and principles, and
apply appropriate mathematical tools and approximations when working on
advanced problems in physics.
During these 3 academic years, I developed several scientific computing
projects, with a focus in data analysis, molecular dynamics and simulations.
The loooong hours spent in the lab exposed my to advanced experimental
methods in collection of experimental data, and I gained experience in
evaluating the significance of the data, drawing relevant conclusions,
applying the appropriate mathematical methods and calculating the
significant statistics (it was worth it after all!).
I also got plenty experience in communicating scientific information and
producing clear and accurate scientific reports.




## Intercultural Exchange Year

- **Institution:** River Ridge High School, USA
- **Classification:** 93% GPA
- **Period:** Aug 2011 - May 2012

Took part in a 1 year exchange program
([AFS - American Field Service](https://afs.org)) for my last year of
secondary studies. Achieved top grades for mathematics, physics and
chemistry with scores ranging from 95% to 100%. Selected for a worldwide
science and engineering competition
([WYSE](https://wyse.engineering.illinois.edu/)) where I won 1st place
in the Physics examination.




## Science & Technology High School Diploma

- **Institution:** Salesianos de Manique, Portugal
- **Classification:** 80% GPA
- **Period:** Sep 2008 - Jun 2011

Took the "Science & Technology" path for my secondary education,
focussing on higher level science and mathematics. Scored 85% on the
Physics & Chemistry national exam, placing me in the country’s top 3%.
