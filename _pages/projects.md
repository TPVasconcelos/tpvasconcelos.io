- **[mdsea](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/mdsea)** -
    `mdsea` is a stand-alone Python molecular dynamics library equipped
    with a flexible simulation engine and multiple analysis tools,
    including fantastic integrated visualisation in 1, 2, and 3
    dimensions. Head over to [mdsea's repo](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/mdsea)
    to check out some of the examples and learn more about the project.


- **[Save-a-Space](/Save-a-Space/)** -
    I built the engine and API that deals with the real-time analysis
    of parking data and occupancy prediction for the
    [Save-a-Space](https://save-a-space.com/) project. Combining modern
    machine learning and web development tools, I was able to deliver
    reliable predictions up to a 99% confidence level.

- **[JekyllMedium](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/JekyllMedium)** -
    Starting from [Jekyll Now](https://www.jekyllnow.com), I designed
    this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme as an attempt to emulate
    the clean look of [Medium](https://medium.com)'s blog platform.
    Have a look at the [live demo](http://tomasvasconcelos.com/JekyllMedium/)
    now!


- **[desa·fios](http://desa-fios.com)** -
    Designed and developed the website and online portfolio for desa·fios,
    an independent jewelry artist based in Estoril, Portugal.


- **[BoxParti](https://github.com/TPVasconcelos/BoxParti)** -
    This is my first ever programming project, developed for a
    "Scientific Computing Skills" module in University. It is a
    Python GUI application that runs simple molecular dynamics simulations.
